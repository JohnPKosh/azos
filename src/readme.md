# AZOS Source Code Root Directory 
See: [Azos Documentation Index](documentation-index.md)

-----

`/src` - all of the primary project source code such as C#, cpp, erl, js, java, etc. is in this folder.

NOTE: The source files for various assets rather than "primary code" (such as
vector graphics/SVGs etc.) are under `/elm`
