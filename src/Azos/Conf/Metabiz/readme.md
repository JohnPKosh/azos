# Metabiz

Metabiz is a version-controlled (like Git) repository of named hierarchies of structured configuration files having
their content attributes and sections inherited from the higher hierarchy levels.
These config files are identified by a full "node path" which are a kin to file system files.

Metabiz may be described as a distributed version-controlled file system of structured config files with file content inheritance capabilities.

Metabiz is useful for managing business and system taxonomies of various kinds, 
e.g. a regional catalog of entities, or risk classifications:

```
#regions/us/east/cle/solon/maple-road
#risk/health/smoking
#risk/health/activity
```
