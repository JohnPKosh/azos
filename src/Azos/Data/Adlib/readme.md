# Azos.Data.Adlib - [A]morphous [D]ata [Lib]rary

Amorphous data library defines a way for working with schema-less document-oriented data
having documents persistently stored in named collections along with indexable ad-hoc 
attributes.

The system is build for horizontal scaling with sharding, optional data expiration, querying 
and reflection.
